# Advent of Code

My projects are taking a toll and I figured to do some mini puzzles. Flex my
mind, reset the cache, and enjoy some simple programming.

## Layout

Each year will have it's own directory and inside will be a directory for each
day and inside of that (lots of nesting, I know) a `makefile`, `main.c`, puzzle
input, and the compiled program.

## Notes

These are the OLD puzzles and will be updated with each solution.
